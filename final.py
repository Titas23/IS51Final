"""
In this program we will write a program that is going to calculate the grades of students for their final exam. 
This program will display the number of grades and also the average grade. 
By reading the final.txt file where the grades are located. 

It will also include the percentage of grades with an above average score. 

In order to begin the program we will have a main function that will start the program.
